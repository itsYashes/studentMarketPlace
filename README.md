## Problem Statement  
Many college students struggle to find affordable and reliable resources such as books, electronics, and other college essentials. Existing marketplaces lack a platform exclusively tailored for students within a campus to buy, sell, or rent items conveniently.  
CampusCart aims to bridge this gap by providing a secure, student-centric marketplace to simplify transactions, foster community interaction, and promote sustainable reuse of items.

CampusCart is a MERN stack-based web application designed exclusively for college students. It provides a platform for students to:  
1. Log in securely using valid Gmail accounts.  
2. Search for college essentials based on categories.  
3. Create, manage, and update product listings for sale or rent.  
4. Mark products as sold/rented or delete them when no longer available.  
5. Connect with product owners through phone numbers or social media for direct negotiations.
